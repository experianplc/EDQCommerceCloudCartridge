##  1\. Summary
The EDQ Commerce Cloud cartridge verify address and validates phone and email data in real time during registration, shipping, billing and address touchpoints; this cartridge supports both SiteGenesis (SGJC) and Storefront (SFRA) workflows.

##  2\. Component Overview
###  2.1\. Functional Overview
The EDQ Commerce Cloud cartridge contains address verification with Pro Web - Address (Verification Engine) and Global Intuitive, as well Global Phone Validate and Email Validate functionality. The sections below describe each of these workflows in more detail.

####  2.1.1\. Email Validate
Email Validation will check your email at the moment you finish typing in the email field box and once you lose focus on the email field the Email Validate will start working letting you know if is a valid or an invalid email.
To configure your Email Validate, you need to access the Business Manager and go to EDQ Config **(`Select Site > Merchant Tools > Site Preferences > Custom Site Preferences Group > EDQ Config`)** and look for the email options.

![Email Options](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JoseCastilloExperian/edqCommerceCloud/master/EDQ%20Cartridge%20Manual%20imgs/211EmailOptions.png)

* The email enable option will enable/disable Email Validate in your store.
* The email validation option will enable/disable the page to prevent on going through. 

The store touchpoints for Email Validate are:
* Registration form.
* Billing/Payment form.

![Email SFRA](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JoseCastilloExperian/edqCommerceCloud/master/EDQ%20Cartridge%20Manual%20imgs/211SFRAview.png)

Email validate can result in two potential outcomes.

Verification Level | Description | Icon
------------ | ------------- | -------------
Verified | Email exists, or is a company internal email, is reachable and is valid. | ![verified Icon](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JoseCastilloExperian/edqCommerceCloud/master/EDQ%20Cartridge%20Manual%20imgs/verifiedIcon.png)
Invalid | Mailbox or domain does not exist or is unreachable, illegitimate or disposable. | ![Invalid Icon](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JoseCastilloExperian/edqCommerceCloud/master/EDQ%20Cartridge%20Manual%20imgs/invalidIcon.png)

####  2.1.2\. Global Phone Validate
Global Phone Validate will check your phone at the moment you finish typing in the phone field box and once you lose focus on the phone field, the Global Phone Validate will start working letting you know if is a valid or an invalid phone.
To configure your Global Phone Validate, you need to access the Business Manager and go to EDQ Config **(`Select Site > Merchant Tools > Site Preferences > Custom Site Preferences Group > EDQ Config`)** and look for the phone options.

![Phone Options](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JoseCastilloExperian/edqCommerceCloud/master/EDQ%20Cartridge%20Manual%20imgs/212%20PhoneOptions.png)

![Phone SFRA View](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JoseCastilloExperian/edqCommerceCloud/master/EDQ%20Cartridge%20Manual%20imgs/212SFRAView.png)

Global Phone Validate can result in two potential outcomes.

Verification Level | Description | Icon
------------ | ------------- | -------------
Verified | Phone matched to a high confidence and returned as a valid number. | ![verified Icon](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JoseCastilloExperian/edqCommerceCloud/master/EDQ%20Cartridge%20Manual%20imgs/verifiedIcon.png)
Invalid | Could not match the number and returned as an invalid number. | ![Invalid Icon](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JoseCastilloExperian/edqCommerceCloud/master/EDQ%20Cartridge%20Manual%20imgs/invalidIcon.png)

####  2.1.3\. Pro Web - Address (Verification Engine)
Pro Web - Address (Verification Engine) will check your address and correct if possible; once you type your address in the respective address fields and press the page form submitting button. 

![Verification SFRA View](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JoseCastilloExperian/edqCommerceCloud/master/EDQ%20Cartridge%20Manual%20imgs/213SFRAView.png)

In case that your address needs to be corrected and does not match an address; Pro Web - Address (Verification Engine) will prompt a “confirm updated address” box to complete your address in real time; by typing down the address in the address input field, it will give you options with accurate addresses matching the address with the information provided by the user and finally by selecting one of the options it will autocomplete the addresses fields in the address form with correct and valid address and may continue with the store process.

![Verification SFRA View 2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JoseCastilloExperian/edqCommerceCloud/master/EDQ%20Cartridge%20Manual%20imgs/213SFRAView2.png)

To configure Pro Web - Address (Verification Engine), you need to access the Business Manager and go to EDQ Config **(`Select Site > Merchant Tools > Site Preferences > Custom Site Preferences Group > EDQ Config`)** and look for the verification engine options.

![Verification Options](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JoseCastilloExperian/edqCommerceCloud/master/EDQ%20Cartridge%20Manual%20imgs/213verificationOptions.png)

* The preferred address search engine option will let you choose between the address search engine options (choose verification engine to only use this selected engine).
* The address layout option lets you choose the structure in which your address will be returned.
* The Pro Web callback validation will let users specify a custom function to manage page transitions. 
* The Pro Web Custom Transition Callback will let you specify a name of a function that will be called in order to define custom transition logic when using Pro Web - Address (Verification Engine). 

The store touchpoints for Pro Web - Address (Verification Engine) are:
* Add/Edit Address form.
* Billing/Payment form.

#### Pro Web Custom Transition Callback
To enable the Pro Web Callback Transition go to the Business Manager and go to the EDQ Config **(`Select Site > Merchant Tools > Site Preferences > Custom Site Preferences Group > EDQ Config`)** and look for the Pro Web Callback Validation option and set the value to true.

![Verification Callback Validation](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JoseCastilloExperian/edqCommerceCloud/master/EDQ%20Cartridge%20Manual%20imgs/213verificationCallbackValidation.PNG)

After enabling the Pro Web Custom Transition Callback, set the value of the Transition Callback Name with the name of your custom function that will be executed prior to transitioning.

![Pro Web Custom Transition Callback](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JoseCastilloExperian/edqCommerceCloud/master/EDQ%20Cartridge%20Manual%20imgs/213verificationCallbackValidationName.png)

Since all logic is in the custom function you need to take in consideration the following points to create your custom function:
- Your custom function should receive a parameter; this is where we are going to send you a JSON with the data response from Pro Web Address (Verification Engine).
e.g.

```javascript
function myCustomFunction(myParameter) {
	....
}
```

The response data from the variable that you're going to receive should look like this example (take note that the way that the data is shown depends on your layout configuration in the Business Manager).

```JSON
{
+4 code: "3208"
City name: "Boston"
Formatted Address 1: null
Formatted Address 2: "53 State St Lbby 2"
Formatted Address 3: "Boston MA 02109-3208"
PO Box: null
PO Box (Number): null
PO Box (Text): null
Primary number: "53"
Secondary number: "Lbby 2"
Secondary number (Number): "2"
Secondary number (Type): "Lbby"
State code: "MA"
State name: "Massachusetts"
Street: "State St"
Street (Descriptor): "St"
Street (Name): "State"
Street (Post-directional): null
Street (Pre-directional): null
ZIP Code: "02109"
}
```

- Your custom function should return a boolean (true or false), depending on your function logic; if your function returns true the page will continue with its normal workflow, if your custom function returns false the page won't make a transition to the next one.

```javascript
	if (customLogic)
		return true;
	else
		return false;
```

####  2.1.4\. Global Intuitive
Global Intuitive will correct your address in real time while your typing down your address in the address field box.

![Global Intuitive SFRA View](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JoseCastilloExperian/edqCommerceCloud/master/EDQ%20Cartridge%20Manual%20imgs/214SFRAView.png)

Global Intuitive will automatically fill the rest of the address fields in the form.

![Global Intuitive SFRA View 2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JoseCastilloExperian/edqCommerceCloud/master/EDQ%20Cartridge%20Manual%20imgs/214SFRAView2.png)

[For more information about Global Intuitive.](https://www.edq.com/documentation/apis/address-validate/global-intuitive/)

To configure Global Intuitive, you need to access the Business Manager and go to EDQ Config **(`Select Site > Merchant Tools > Site Preferences > Custom Site Preferences Group > EDQ Config`)** and look for the global intuitive option.

![Global Intuitive Options](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JoseCastilloExperian/edqCommerceCloud/master/EDQ%20Cartridge%20Manual%20imgs/214globalOptions.png)
